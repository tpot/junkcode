This repository houses my junkcode.

Junk code is a collection of code fragments, configuration files and
scripts that aren't really worthy of a separate project or repository,
but are nonetheless useful on a regular basis.

Andrew Tridgell did a talk at linux.conf.au many years ago coining the
phrase junkcode and giving a tour of his junkcode directory.  Slides
for the presentation are found here:
